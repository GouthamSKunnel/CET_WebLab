<h4>Plot</h4>
<p id="plot">
The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an 
extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving 
the Tesseract,[N 2] a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the 
Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick 
Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote
 research facility, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team 
experimenting on the Tesseract. The Tesseract suddenly activates and 
opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the 
Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, 
including Clint Barton, to aid him.

In response, Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative". Agent Natasha 
Romanoff heads to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the 
Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve 
Rogers to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony 
Stark to have him check Selvig's research.

Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals the iridium needed to 
stabilize the Tesseract's power, leading to a confrontation with Rogers,
 Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki gets 
escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees 
him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. 
Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying 
aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier, where he is imprisoned.

The Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation
 that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop powerful 
weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As they argue,
 Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress 
causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to 
restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's 
rampage. Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki's mind 
control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and Fury uses Coulson's 
death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Loki uses the 
Tesseract and a wormhole generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above
 Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.

Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk rally in defense of 
New York City, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri. The Hulk 
beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, 
where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's 
scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World 
Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear 
missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it 
through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, 
destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. 
Stark's suit loses power, and he goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves 
him. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to 
Asgard, where Loki will face their justice.

In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master[N 3] about the
 failed attack on Earth.

<h4>cast</h4>
<p id="cast">
</p><ul>
<li>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:<br>
A self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with 
an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention. Downey was cast
 as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included 
Iron Man 2 (2010) and The Avengers.[11] He said he initially pushed 
Whedon to make Stark the lead: "Well, I said, 'I need to be in the 
opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to 
drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and 
it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and
 the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of 
the octopus."[12] About the character's evolution from previous films, 
Downey said, "In Iron Man, which was an origin story, he was his own 
epiphany and redemption of sorts. Iron Man 2 is all about not being an 
island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In 
The Avengers, he's throwing it down with the others".[13] Downey earned 
$50 million from the film, "once box-office bonuses and backend 
compensation [were] factored in.
</li>
<br>
<li>Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:<br>
A World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality
 by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before 
waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star 
in three Marvel films, in addition to The Avengers.[15] Evans said that 
Steve Rogers is much darker in The Avengers: "It's just about him trying
 to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's 
enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely 
different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared 
about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle 
with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I
 think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. 
It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a 
balance with the modern world."[12] Regarding the dynamic between Rogers
 and Tony Stark, Evans said, "I think there's certainly a dichotomy—this
 kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar 
opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy 
is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get 
along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun."[16] Evans earned $2–3 
million for the film.[14]
</li>
<br>
<li>Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:<br>
A genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, 
transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was 
considered to play Banner in The Incredible Hulk (2008) before Edward 
Norton took the role,[17] was cast after negotiations between Marvel and
 Norton broke down.[18] About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, "I'm a 
friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go 
down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I 
look at it as my generation's Hamlet." About the character, he said, 
"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the 
light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of 
control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a 
really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the 
part has those qualities".[19] Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, 
Ruffalo said, "He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on
 their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in 
the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!"[20] This is 
the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the 
Hulk. Ruffalo told New York magazine, "I'm really excited. No one's ever
 played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do 
the Avatar stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the 
Hulk. That'll be fun".[21] The 3D model used to create the Hulk's body 
was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, 
while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.[22] To create the 
Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of Lou Ferrigno and
 others;[23] however, the Hulk's only speaking line ("Puny god.") was 
provided solely by Ruffalo.[24] Ruffalo earned $2–3 million for the 
film.[14
</li>
<li>Chris Hemsworth as Thor:<br>
The crown prince of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the
 same name. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal.[25] He 
had previously worked with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods 
(2011).[26] Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he 
built up for Thor (2011) by increasing his food intake, consisting of 
chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how
 much, Hemsworth said, "My body weight in protein pretty much!"[27] He 
remarked that Thor's motivation "is much more of a personal one, in the 
sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone
 else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different 
approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the 
greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . .
 I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the 
only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that."[12]
 Hemsworth earned $2–3 million for the film.[14]

<h4>development</h4>
<p id="development">Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in 
2003,[56] with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing 
plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises 
declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate 
of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures.[57] Marvel 
discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; 
the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main 
characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with 
them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film.[58] 
Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk, became attached to
 the film in 2006,[56] and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film
 in June 2007.[59] In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America
 strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure 
that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, 
including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers.[60] After the 
successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 
2011 release date for The Avengers.[61] In September 2008, Marvel 
Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous 
partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future 
Marvel films.[62]

Casting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.[11] Though Don 
Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War 
Machine for The Avengers, he later stated that he did not think the 
character would appear in the film.[11][63] At the same time, two major 
prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an 
executive producer for the film,[11] and the company signed a long-term 
lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron 
Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)—at their 
Manhattan Beach, California complex.[64] In February 2009, Samuel L. 
Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play 
Nick Fury in Iron Man 2 and other films.[45] In September 2009, Edward 
Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he 
was open to returning in the film.[65] The next month, executive 
producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would
 "definitely have input and a say". Favreau also expressed concerns, 
stating, "It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating 
the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and 
then with Avengers you're going to be introducing some supernatural 
aspects because of Thor [...] [Mixing] the two of those works very well 
in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to 
make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created".[66] In 
March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in 
portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently 
attached her to The Avengers.[28] The following day, Marvel announced 
that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost
 a full year later.[67] Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the 
film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.[25]

In July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, "My job 
is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that 
finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these 
movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where
 everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . 
I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the 
movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual 
ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority".[68] At 
first, Penn tried to reduce Thor's role in the script because he had 
doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. He changed his 
mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor.[69] The film had always intended 
to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had 
considered using Red Skull.[70]

In January 2010, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would 
be difficult to meld the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science 
fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers. "No," he said, "because we're 
doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski Thor.
 We're not doing the 
blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library Thor. And in the
 Thor of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And 
we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real 
science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about 
teaching people that".[71] In March, it was reported that Penn had 
completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief
 Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had 
received copies.[72] Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to 
play Captain America in three films including The Avengers.[15] </p>
